Achievement marks the second year in a row the company has been recognized by the prestigious international annual awards program
Woebot Health today announced that it has won the “Mental Health Innovation Award” in the 8th annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards program conducted by MedTech Breakthrough, an independent market intelligence organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global digital health and medical technology market. The honor recognizes the Woebot Health Platform, which is built on a foundation of clinically proven techniques and infused with artificial intelligence (AI). The platform offers instantly accessible, chat-based, adjunctive mental health support and the tools and insights needed to enhance the care experience, automate the collection of population insights and increase provider efficiency. The award also recognizes Woebot, the digital companion at the heart of the platform that delivers personalized, in-the-moment support through chat-based conversations and techniques. Woebot’s conversations are written by conversational writers using elements from evidence-based approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), along with collaboration from clinical experts. “We’re thrilled and honored to once again receive an award from MedTech Breakthrough,” said Woebot Health CEO Michael Evers. “We’re seeing more real world evidence that shows how innovative digital solutions can help payors and providers better understand and serve member and patient populations, and become the foundation for even greater advancements in the future.” The mission of the MedTech Breakthrough Awards is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of health and medical technology categories, including Telehealth, Clinical Administration, Patient Engagement, Electronic Health Records (EHR), Virtual Care, Medical Devices, Medical Data & Privacy, and many more. This year’s program attracted thousands of nominations from over 18 different countries throughout the world. “Traditional mental health care is not always there when it’s needed, and mental health issues are front and center in a global conversation, especially with younger populations,” said Steve Johansson, managing director, MedTech Breakthrough. “Woebot Health is addressing this challenge head on, standing as a mental health ally that is engaging people in their breakthrough mental health solutions at scale. We extend our sincere congratulations to the Woebot Health team for taking home our Mental Health Innovation Award in 2024.”。![图片](https://ai-techpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Woebot-Health-960x540.jpg){ width=60% }
