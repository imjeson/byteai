 (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that Professor Axel Lehrer, University of Hawaiʽi at Mānoa (UHM), will be presenting key data from the Company’s thermostable vaccine technology platform developed in collaboration with UHM, including results from the filovirus vaccine candidates for both Sudan ebolavirus (SuVax™) and Marburg marburgvirus (MarVax™). The presentation will be given at the upcoming American Society of Microbiology (ASM) Microbe Conference, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, June 13-17, 2024. The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion comparing advanced vaccine technologies and their advantages and disadvantages. Oral Presentation / Panel Discussion: Session Title: Immune Responses to Viral Vaccine Platforms: Comparison of Live, mRNA, and Protein Subunit Vaccines on June 17, 2024 from 8:15-10:15 am. The official conference program can be found here. Oral Presentation Title: Thermostable, adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines reduce logistical concerns and induce durable immunity presented by Axel Lehrer; University of Hawaiʽi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI on June 17, 2024 at 8:45 AM – 9:15 AM. Under the Company’s Public Health Solutions business segment, Soligenix is developing thermostabilized subunit vaccines. Thermostabilization is achieved by using a combination of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) excipients and lyophilization (freeze-drying) to yield a single-vial presentation of vaccine that is stable at ambient and higher temperatures and that can be reconstituted with water for injection immediately prior to use. Mono-, bi- and tri-valent vaccine candidates for filoviruses (including Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus) have demonstrated complete protection in non-human primate challenge studies using thermostabilized formulations. Soligenix has recently been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the prevention and post-exposure prophylaxis against both Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus.
