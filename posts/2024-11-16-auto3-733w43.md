 The Playbook leverages the Cybernetix team’s combined 50 years of past and ongoing experience and a forward-looking vision to create a guide for founders, investors and ecosystem leaders in robotics. With insights into critical topics—like choosing vertical markets and use cases, product scoping and development to balance hardware with scalable software, and models to maximize revenue—it allows founders, investors and leaders to make informed decisions in a rapidly accelerating industry that is poised for explosive growth. The Robotics Startup Playbook currently contains six chapters that will be released throughout the coming months. It is for entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem leaders who see the powerful mega-trends of robotics, industrial AI, and automation and who want to learn the key success factors and common challenges of building, scaling, and investing in these areas. “Whether you’re an investor looking to understand the unique dynamics of robotics as a unique investment class, or an entrepreneur aiming to build and scale a disruptive robotics company, this playbook is for you,” said Fady Saad, Founder & Managing Partner, Cybernetix Ventures. “It’s designed to provide actionable insights, highlight common pitfalls, and guide industry leaders in shaping the future of robotics.” Founded in 2021, Cybernetix Ventures supports the most promising robotics founders and startups by partnering with robotics clusters worldwide to elevate these companies to a global stage, connecting them with a diverse ecosystem of potential customers, later-stage investors, financial institutions, and acquirers. “There are a lot of misconceptions about robotics. It’s no longer such a capital-intensive endeavor and the paths to revenues and scaling can be much faster than in the past. But, the funding profile can be different as compared to SaaS investing. It’s quite typical to see an additional seed round or additional Series A round to get to revenue acceleration and P&L that a growth stage investor wants to see,” commented Mark Martin, Co-founder & General Partner, Cybernetix Ventures. “The reward with good robotics startups is very sticky businesses with high value deployed hardware that can be combined with additional revenue streams from data, value-added software, services, and consumables. So, while robotics requires a shift in mindset for investors, those who understand the long-term value stand to benefit significantly.” Explore AITechPark for the latest advancements in AI, IOT, Cybersecurity, AITech News, and insightful updates from industry experts!
