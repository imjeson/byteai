 AI remains a major trend, attracting industry leaders, including the highest number of CEOs in COMPUTEX history. In celebration, Taipei 101 will be illuminated for COMPUTEX, with GIGABYTE lighting it up on June 4 from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM, promoting the AI event and welcoming international guests. Prominent leaders in global chip development will attend COMPUTEX, aiming to assert their influence in the AI era and strengthen ties with the Taiwanese supply chain. GIGABYTE, an integral part of this industry, is honored to invite these CEOs to its booth to explore the latest technologies. GIGABYTE’s diverse product lineup spans the entire AI lifecycle, featuring industry-leading technologies and flexible server solutions. These products, designed to meet future computing demands with advanced cooling solutions, will be showcased on an unprecedented scale at COMPUTEX. Additionally, GIGABYTE will present its Red Dot Award-winning PC products, new products demos, and AI experiences for gamers and creators. GIGABYTE has consistently been the fastest to market with the most diverse range of AI servers. This year, the G593 flagship AI server series, known for its high-density features and flexible design, is displayed to support NVIDIA’s next-gen chips H200 and B100, as well as models designed for AMD’s MI300X. The showcase will also feature the new X series servers, based on NVIDIA’s MGX modular design, which shortens development times and accelerates data center deployment. Customers can choose between AMD EPYC, Intel Xeon x86 CPUs, or NVIDIA Grace Hopper Arm superchips, offering tailored configurations for specific computational needs. Large Language Models (LLM) have become increasingly popular in AI. To handle the growing number of parameters, GIGABYTE is showcasing servers supporting NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell architecture, featuring the highly acclaimed high-density designs with the powerful B100 and B200 superchips. The B100 will be compatible with the G593 series hardware, while the B200’s next-level performance introduces thermal challenges beyond the capacity of traditional air cooling. GIGABYTE has addressed this with its industry-leading thermal engineering by employing direct liquid cooling. The highly anticipated GB200 will also be demonstrated in a liquid-cooled cabinet as the GB200 NVL72, acting as a massive GPU that can achieve 30 times the inference performance of an equivalent number of H100 GPUs. This allows visitors not only to witness these innovations firsthand but also to engage in discussions about the future of AI development and computing deployment. Introducing GIGA...
