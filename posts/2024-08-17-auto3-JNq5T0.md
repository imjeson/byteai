 Integrated seamlessly into its existing platform, this advanced system is purpose-built to enhance MSPs’ and IT professionals’ efficiency in resolving tickets, significantly reducing the time and effort required.
Built on the feedback from early adopters who experienced marked improvements in operational efficiency, Syncro’s new offering is now available to all partners on the Team Plan within its IT management platform.
Syncro’s AI-powered Smart Ticket Management not only classifies and suggests resolutions for incoming tickets but also introduces an intuitive Smart Search capability, enhancing the way technicians manage and resolve tickets. This feature allows technicians to find solutions more quickly with context-aware searches and a natural language interface.
The Smart Ticket Management feature set is designed from the ground up to integrate seamlessly into the daily workflows of technicians. By automating the initial steps of ticket management — such as classification and suggesting initial resolution steps — Syncro streamlines the process for technicians. It also offers a robust search tool that uses natural language processing (NLP), which ensures that every technician, regardless of experience level, has the tools to excel at their fingertips.
“Our Smart Ticket Management solution is transformational for the MSP and IT markets,” said Michael George, CEO, Syncro. “By leveraging AI to automate and simplify the ticket resolution process, we’re enabling our partners to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. This launch represents our ongoing commitment to providing innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.”
Key Features and Benefits
Smart Ticket Search
A powerful ticket search engine leverages NLP to find the most relevant tickets based on a query. This tool understands and finds tickets that match the intention and core issue, even if the keywords don’t match. Smart Ticket Search also works in context, automatically finding tickets closely related to the ticket currently being viewed, ensuring that relevant information is always available.
Guided Ticket Resolution
Automatic Ticket Classification – When a ticket is created (either by a user or by an alert), the solution automatically classifies the ticket based on its contents. For example, tickets may be labeled for issues related to printers, network, storage, memory, CPU, and other categories (up to 47 different categories at release).
Guided Resolution Steps – Syncro’s Smart Ticket Management system creates guided resolution steps with a convenient checklist embedded in the ticket. Many tickets include links to scripts and automations, enabling technicians to resolve issues with a simple click.
Positive feedback from early users underscores the impact of Syncro’s solution.
“Smart Ticket Management bridges the skills gap between Level 0 and Level 1 technicians, providing my team with clear, actionable solutions from the first touch,” said Jasper Grewal, president of ROI Technology. “The Smart Search feature shows incredible potential in reducing time spent on cross-ticket investigation, while the guided ticket resolution empowers our junior techs to find the correct solution more quickly.”
“Syncro remains dedicated to continuous innovation, and this release is evidence of our journey towards fully leveraging automation and AI to enhance IT solutions,” said Dee Zepf, chief product officer, Syncro. “Our unique approach of embedding AI deeply into the platform is setting a new standard in the industry.”
The new Smart Ticket Management capability is available now as part of Syncro’s all-in-one platform.
