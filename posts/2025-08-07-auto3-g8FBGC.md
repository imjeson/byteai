, a pioneer in healthcare artificial intelligence, today announced the launch of “Pieces in your Pocket”, an advanced phone-based personal assistant for inpatient physicians that revolutionizes clinical documentation. Using their mobile device, physicians can simply tell Pieces the main points they want in their patient progress note in as short as 30-45 seconds. Pieces then generates a fully formed note in the electronic medical record incorporating all of the physician’s key points using its working longitudinal understanding of the patient, the physician’s prior notes and authorship style, and the patient’s current issues and results.  
Unlike traditional ambient listening solutions from competitors in the market space that require physicians to record entire patient encounters, Pieces in your Pocket focuses on brief, targeted interactions that respect physicians’ workflow preferences while delivering superior documentation outcomes.  
“We’re creating the first AI clinical assistant that understands how physicians actually think about patient care,” said Dr. Ruben Amarasingham, chief executive officer and founder of Pieces Technologies. “Instead of talking to technology, physicians can talk with it about their patients through quick, meaningful interactions.”  
Conversational Intelligence vs. Transcription  
What distinguishes Pieces in your Pocket from existing ambient solutions is its focus on efficiency over transcription. To write progress notes, Pieces in your Pocket combines the Pieces comprehension and LLM engines, with a standard proactive Voice to voice or multi-modal response based on user preference. The interactive nature of Pieces in your Pocket will fundamentally transform the way that physicians work.  
Building on its successful approach to clinical reasoning and comprehension, as displayed in the autonomous creation of over 10 million inpatient clinical summaries for customers across multiple care settings, safety-net hospitals, quaternary care facilities, academic medical centers, regional hospitals, and pediatric hospitals. Pieces’ new solution moves into the ambient listening space in a novel way.  
“What’s different about our approach is that Pieces is not scribing the ambulatory patient encounter,” says Josh Grob, VP of Engineering at Pieces. “We think shorter, impactful interactions are more effective in the increasingly complex acute care environment.”  
Comprehensive Clinical Intelligence  
The intelligent documentation assistant transforms how physicians manage patient records. The system captures new information and events since the last progress note, eliminating copy-forward errors while drawing insights from the entire EMR. It provides real-time documentation improvement suggestions to ensure notes accurately reflect patient care and status. Pieces in your Pocket features built-in alerts that notify physicians of discrepancies and enables seamless querying of patient records. At its core, Pieces offers a novel approach through quick voice memos that are intelligently summarized, reviewed, and integrated into comprehensive progress notes. This allows physicians to complete accurate documentation on the go, essentially providing a personal assistant for clinical record-keeping.
