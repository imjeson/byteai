我完全同意Jonathan Freedland，只有一个方面除外（您知道还有谁应该为英国极右翼骚乱接受审讯？埃隆·马斯克，8月9日）。他也许对政治家、记者、意见领袖甚至政府难以离开X平台表示赞同，但他们甚至没有考虑过如何发起针对埃隆·马斯克的有效消费者抵制行动，只要他是这个平台的所有者，滥用并以专制方式控制着它。马斯克表示支持唐纳德·特朗普，并在X上推广了德国的德国新选择党，他还宣扬了英国极右翼政治暴力，而没有遇到任何严肃的阻力。因此，在他仍是X平台的所有者，滥用该平台谋求政治目的的情况下，应当有足够的基础组织起义。您可能会高兴地听到，您的文章已经让我彻底失去对这个人的耐心。在加入13年后，我刚刚注销了我的X账户。Eckart Hoffmann德国、Schenefeld
Jonathan Freedland rightly asks why Elon Musk is not more widely censured for his role in stirring up social unrest in western democracies.Musk is given particular kudos by his fellowship of the Royal Society, the world’s oldest and most respected scientific community, which has so far failed to retract this award. While previous commercial partners in Musk’s business ventures are leaving in droves, the society appears not to appreciate the reputational damage increasingly associated with unaccountable demagogues. I would urge any fellows who recognise the risk to make their views known.David Morris Castanet, France The Online Safety Act is already being criticised as inadequate (Online Safety Act not fit for purpose after far-right riots, says Sadiq Khan, 8 August). But there is already a legal duty on employers to reduce the risks to the public from their business activities “so far as is reasonably practicable”.Significant failure to control such risks is a crime under the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, and penalties in the worst cases in other industries have included very large fines for the company and prison sentences for company directors.Elon Musk could easily ban Tommy Robinson from X, for example. Other agitators’ accounts could be identified and removed from social media. Is there a reason why the act is not used to force the directors of social media companies to act responsibly?Prof Martyn Thomas Emeritus professor, Gresham College I am a councillor in Canterbury, and false rumours circulating on Tuesday last week meant that traders didn’t open for the Wednesday market, so they lost money. False rumours on the Wednesday said that there was a riot at the bus station – there wasn’t, but people decided not to travel in. False rumours about smashed windows and closed shops meant that the normally very busy streets were almost devoid of people. Shops missed out on trade. Canterbury cathedral closed its gates to tourists.It’s not just X but also Elon Musk who amplified people’s fears. I’m pleased that people who spread false rumours have been charged. I will pay tribute to the police who made sure that the 40 or so protesters couldn’t access Canterbury mosque, and the security guards and council enforcement officers who patrolled the city’s streets to reassure people.Connie NolanCanterbury  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
