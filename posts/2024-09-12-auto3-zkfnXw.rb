 With ITMX, government agencies can reduce Tier 1 support costs with a full-featured IT service management (ITSM) platform that is less complex and costly to deploy and manage than competitors, while accelerating application delivery through AI and automation. Public sector organizations face a number of significant challenges when delivering IT services including a reliance on aging legacy systems, high service demands and expectations, as well as resource and budget constraints. According to a survey by Forrester Research, 78% of public sector organizations consider ITSM solutions crucial for delivering on their digital transformation goals. Implementing advanced ITSM solutions helps streamline operations, reduce downtime, and enhance the overall effectiveness of IT systems by providing structured frameworks for managing incidents, problems, and changes.
