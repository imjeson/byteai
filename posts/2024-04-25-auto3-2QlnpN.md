 (Nasdaq: EXTR), a leader in cloud networking, today announced the launch of Extreme Labs: a dynamic ecosystem where creativity, collaboration and cutting-edge technology converge to fuel innovation of early-stage technologies. Extreme Labs is a premier venue for the company to showcase technology innovation as it becomes closer to commercial availability. Extreme Labs drives the prioritization of technology development with wide impact, as demonstrated by the work the company is doing with Living Tomorrow to jointly promote and design innovative products that are likely to become widely adopted by the year 2030.
Today, Extreme demonstrated its first technology preview from Extreme Labs: Extreme AI Expert. Building on Extreme’s investment in AI beyond its ExtremeCloud™ IQ CoPilot AIOps solution, Extreme AI Expert is a Generative AI solution that delivers substantial optimizations and cost savings in the design, deployment and management of enterprise networking and security. Unlike solutions that limit and silo data and knowledge, Extreme AI Expert is designed to go beyond public product and network optimization knowledge to deliver the best insights. It will securely and effectively combine public data with customers’ private data to create proactive recommendations that make it easy for customers to accelerate the discovery of information and solve problems across their networking environment.
Future benefits include:
- Acting as an expert on Extreme products and services to help work faster and smarter: seamlessly accessing rich data from hundreds of thousands of source documents, translated into several languages. Data will be pulled from a combination of Extreme’s public repository, knowledge base and Global Technical Assistance Center (GTAC) documentation.
- Leveraging data from the network and beyond to improve performance and operational efficiency: pulling and combining data from applications and devices across the network to establish intelligence on performance and experience. Extreme AI Expert will curate enterprise data to provide insights, automate operations and create alerts when it detects anomalies like network overload, degradation or Wi-Fi dead spots, among others.
- Turning insights into expertise and action: recommending preventative actions and network optimizations based on business KPIs. Extreme AI Expert creates suggestions and best practices to troubleshoot, resolve or proactively address issues.
Extreme will provide a tech preview of Extreme AI Expert on the mainstage at Extreme Connect today in Fort Worth, Texas.
“At our core, we fuel innovation. With Extreme Labs, we’re not just pushing boundaries; we’re rewriting them and redefining norms. We embody the ethos of simplifying networking and challenging conventions. Extreme AI Expert is just another example of how we create best-in-class technology that empowers customers to drive impactful outcomes. Collaborating with customers and partners throughout the innovation cycle gives them a voice and sets a bar of excellence, especially as we fully immerse ourselves in an era of AI, networking and security convergence,” said Nabil Bukhari, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Extreme Networks.
Availability
Extreme AI Expert is currently a tech preview. Extreme expects to start integrating the technology into solutions later this year.
