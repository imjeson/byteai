As someone who has followed Tesla's progress closely, wlockett wonders what he would do if he were in Musk's shoes, guiding the company towards its goals.

**Focus on Software**

Wlockett believes that Tesla's software capabilities are severely underutilized, and he would focus on developing a more comprehensive software suite for Tesla's vehicles. He envisions a system that integrates seamlessly with the car's hardware to provide a truly unique driving experience. This would include advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like Autopilot, as well as features like over-the-air updates and remote diagnostics.

**Expand Charging Infrastructure**

Wlockett suggests that Tesla should prioritize expanding its charging infrastructure network. He proposes building more Supercharger stations, especially in rural areas where charging options are limited. Additionally, he recommends investing in third-party charging networks to provide a seamless experience for Tesla owners who venture outside of the company's proprietary infrastructure.

**Diversify Product Line**

The author believes that Tesla should diversify its product line by introducing new vehicle models and body styles. This would include SUVs, trucks, and even electric boats, which could appeal to a broader audience. Wlockett also suggests exploring partnerships with other automakers to co-develop new vehicles, potentially leveraging their existing manufacturing capacity.

**Improve Customer Service**

Wlockett notes that Tesla's customer service has received criticism in the past. He would prioritize improving the company's support structure by hiring more staff and implementing a more efficient system for handling customer inquiries. Additionally, he recommends expanding Tesla's retail network to provide more convenient shopping experiences for customers.

**Electrify the Grid**

Wlockett advocates for Tesla to take a more active role in electrifying the grid. He suggests partnering with utility companies to develop smart charging systems that can stabilize the grid during peak energy demand periods. This would not only benefit the environment but also create new revenue streams for Tesla through its Powerwall and SolarCity products.

**Prioritize Sustainability**

Wlockett emphasizes the importance of prioritizing sustainability in all aspects of Tesla's operations. He believes that the company should strive to reduce its environmental impact by implementing more eco-friendly practices, such as recycling batteries and minimizing waste.

**Invest in Autonomy**

The author suggests investing heavily in autonomous driving technology, which he sees as a key differentiator for Tesla. He envisions a future where Tesla vehicles can operate independently, reducing the need for human intervention and improving road safety.

**Establish Partnerships**

Wlockett recommends establishing partnerships with other companies, governments, and organizations to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide. This could include collaborations with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft to deploy EV fleets, or working with cities to develop comprehensive EV infrastructure plans.

**Foster a Positive Company Culture**

Finally, Wlockett stresses the importance of fostering a positive company culture within Tesla. He believes that prioritizing employee satisfaction, well-being, and professional development would lead to increased job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and improved overall performance.

In conclusion, wlockett's vision for Tesla focuses on software, infrastructure expansion, product diversification, customer service improvement, grid electrification, sustainability, autonomy investment, partnerships, and a positive company culture. These initiatives could help position Tesla as a leader in the electric vehicle industry and drive its continued growth and success.
