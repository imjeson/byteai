AI investment fever continues, with a shift from "soft" to "hard" catching the attention of capital. After a ripple of overseas startups, a wave of AI smart glasses investment frenzy swept China in mid-August this year. Combining large models with hardware, Byte began exploring AI hardware by developing its own AI hardware and cooperating with external hardware companies.

In essence, it's a fusion of software and hardware. Byte's entry into AI hardware seems similar to many startups, treating hardware as a "gateway" to access AI capabilities and services for users, integrating Chat bot products through APIs to enable users to interact with AI assistants without taking out their phones.

2024 is touted as the year of AI applications, yet product differentiation remains elusive. While the Super App seems out of reach, wearable hardware, still nascent domestically, may be Byte's key to standing out amidst the competition.

Byte's AI hardware and Bot Platform team leader Kayden has previous startup experience in basic software and hardware, which hints at Byte's larger ambitions in AI hardware.

The reincarnation of software and hardware seems crucial in the AI landscape. AI applications face challenges in user conversion, with independent large model applications having limited user engagement compared to platform-level applications.

With the maturity of the capital market, equity acquisitions become key for internet companies to consolidate their core business or enter new emerging avenues. Byte's acquisition of the open-air headphone brand Oladance represents its foray into the hardware space.

AI's entry into human-machine interaction and software-hardware collaboration lies in better information input, making hardware not just a service access channel but also a means to collect various aspects of user information in daily life.

Byte is strategically positioned in the AI and hardware landscape but must navigate the industry's watchful eyes to avoid the pitfalls of previous AI hardware ventures.

The article highlights past strategic investments by Byte, emphasizing caution in its approach towards AI hardware. Despite its history of strategic hesitance, Byte seems well-positioned in the evolving AI landscape.

Overall, Byte's focus on hardware appears to be the missing puzzle piece in its full product strategy, solidifying its presence in the AI industry in China.
