 Radiant Logic was recognized in the Authentication & Identity category for its groundbreaking work in unifying identity data and delivering real-time visibility to speed IAM operations and reduce identity risk across complex enterprise environments.
The Fortress Cybersecurity Awards honor the industry’s top organizations and individuals who are advancing the state of security through measurable innovation and a commitment to best practices. This recognition follows a series of major product enhancements from Radiant Logic, including the announcement of Identity Observability in the RadiantOne platform, equipping security teams with continuous monitoring, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time remediation across distributed identity infrastructures.
“The volume and complexity of threats facing organizations today is growing by the minute,” said Russ Fordyce, CEO of the Business Intelligence Group. “The winners of this year’s Fortress Cybersecurity Awards are not only keeping up—they’re setting the pace. We’re proud to honor Radiant Logic for developing identity-centric solutions that are essential to the future of secure access and Zero Trust.”
Radiant Logic’s win highlights the impact of its AI-powered identity observability engine and graph-based data unification model, which together help enterprises detect misconfigurations, eliminate orphaned accounts, and improve compliance through a unified view of identity across Active Directory, cloud services, SaaS applications, and more.
“We’re honored to be recognized by the Business Intelligence Group,” said Dr. John Pritchard, CEO, Radiant Logic. “As identity becomes the dominant threat vector in today’s cybersecurity landscape, our mission is to give organizations the visibility and intelligence they need to secure access at scale. This award is a testament to our team’s innovation and relentless focus on helping customers ensure a more resilient identity infrastructure.”
