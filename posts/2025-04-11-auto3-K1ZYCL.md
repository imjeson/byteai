 As the creator of Oracle RAC (Real Applications Clusters), Angelo brings a wealth of knowledge and leadership in AI, data management and optimization to the Aquila Clouds team. While at Oracle, he managed an expansive product portfolio that included Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS), Automated Storage Management (ASM), and Oracle Database Appliance (ODA), among others. Angelo managed a product portfolio with multi-billion USD revenue per annum for Oracle.

Suchit Kaura, Co-Founder and CEO of Aquila Clouds, shared his enthusiasm, stating, “We look forward to Angelo leading us to new heights in our focus on cloud and AI financial management. Our goal to leverage AI for FinOps and create application aware solutions, will advance significantly under Angelo’s leadership.” Suchit also noted that he and Angelo created Oracle RAC together many years ago and grew it into a multi-billion dollar business.

Angelo Pruscino emphasized, “Aquila Clouds’ vision greatly differentiates itself from other competitors in the FinOps space. I am confident that I can help the company experience the same explosive growth that I brought to Oracle with the multi-billion dollar product portfolio I managed.”

Angelo’s immediate focus will be to work with the Aquila Clouds management team to define product lines for modern and AI workloads such as Kubernetes, Databricks, LLM and Agentic AI, with the goal of capturing the number one position in cloud and AI financial management solutions worldwide.
