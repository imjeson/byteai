Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced its Symantec Cloud Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solution received Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®) authorization, further expanding Broadcom’s portfolio of FedRAMP authorized solutions for the U.S. sector. Symantec Cloud SWG delivers comprehensive, cloud-hosted security for U.S. federal agencies adopting a Security Service Edge (SSE) architecture.
