Cybernetix Ventures is participating in the Agriculture & Robotics Summit, where agriculture market leaders are meeting with robotics innovators to solve industry pain points.

Cybernetix Ventures, the leading early-stage venture capital firm focused on robotics, automation, and industrial AI, today announced a strategic partnership with the Pittsburgh Robotics Network (PRN), as part of the firm’s long-term robotics cluster engagement efforts. The partnership is a joint initiative to set Pittsburgh’s robotics startups up for success and bring more of the cluster’s investable robotics opportunities to global markets.

Founded in 2021, Cybernetix works with robotics clusters around the world to elevate the most promising robotics founders and startups to the global stage, connecting them to the firm’s diverse ecosystem of potential customers, later-stage investors, financial institutions, and acquirers. Cybernetix will join forces with the Pittsburgh Robotics Network as a Leader Premier Partner and provide their advisory to its startups.

“The Pittsburgh Robotics Network is one of the top robotics clusters in the U.S., with a powerhouse team and strong robotics innovators emerging,” said Fady Saad, Founder & GP of Cybernetix Ventures. “Like our firm, the PRN is focused on markets-driven, actionable, scalable use cases for robotics. We are excited to amplify their efforts and connect the cluster further with the larger investment community.”

“Cybernetix Ventures is a premier investment firm for robotics, and this partnership represents a unique opportunity for not only robotics companies but for accelerating the commercial adoption of robotics solutions overall,” said Jennifer Apicella, Executive Director of the Pittsburgh Robotics Network. “Both Cybernetix Ventures and the PRN share a set of aligned values that promise to bring significant benefits to robotics companies on the path to commercialization. We admire their unique expertise and understanding of how robotics will directly contribute to the advancement of specific industries, both now and into the future.”

The partnership announcement comes alongside The Agriculture & Robotics Summit, where the Pittsburgh Robotics Network is welcoming agriculture innovators, investors, and industry to the city to explore the future of smart agriculture. Cybernetix, which has focused on vertical robotics applications in manufacturing, logistics, construction, and healthcare since its inception, is participating in the event as a launchpad for their new expanded focus on agriculture and climate robotics.

“The new use cases and overall necessity for robotics innovation in agriculture have accelerated the sector’s investment potential, and we will explore investments in agriculture and climate robotics to add to our solid portfolio,” said Saad. “The work the Pittsburgh Robotics Network is doing to bring the industry’s largest customers together with the brightest minds in robotics is exactly in line with how we like to approach robotics business building at Cybernetix.”
