 These technologies are used for virtual assistants, recommendation systems, content generation, and more. They help organizations build a competitive advantage through data-driven decision making, automation, enhanced business processes, and customer experiences.
Apache Airflow is at the core of many teams’ ML operations, and with new integrations for Large Language Models (LLMs), Airflow enables these teams to build production-quality applications with the latest advancements in ML and AI.
Simplifying ML Development
All too frequently, machine learning models and predictive analytics are created in silos, far removed from production systems and applications. Organizations face a perpetual challenge to turn a lone data scientist’s notebook into a production-ready application with stability, scaling, compliance, etc.
Organizations that standardize on one platform for orchestrating both their DataOps and MLOps workflows, however, are able to reduce not only the friction of end-to-end development but also infrastructure costs and IT sprawl. While it may seem counterintuitive, these teams also benefit from more choice. When the centralized orchestration platform, like Apache Airflow, is open-source and includes integrations to nearly every data tool and platform, data and ML teams can pick the tools that work best for their needs while enjoying the benefits of standardization, governance, simplified troubleshooting, and reusability.
Apache Airflow and Astro (Astronomer’s fully managed Airflow orchestration platform) is the place where data engineers and ML engineers meet to create business value from operational ML. With a massive number of data engineering pipelines running on Airflow every day across every industry and sector, it is the workhorse of modern data operations, and ML teams can piggyback off of this foundation for not only model inference but also training, evaluation, and monitoring.
Optimizing Airflow for Enhanced ML Applications
As organizations continue to find ways to leverage large language models, Airflow is increasingly front and center for the operationalization of things like unstructured data processing, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), feedback processing, and fine-tuning of foundation models. To support these new use-cases and to provide a starting point for Airflow users, Astronomer has worked with the Airflow Community to create Ask Astro—as a public reference implementation of RAG with Airflow for conversational AI.
More broadly, Astronomer has led the development of new integrations with vector databases and LLM providers to support this new breed of applications and the pipelines that are needed to keep them safe, fresh, and manageable.
Connect to the Most Widely Used LLM Services and Vector Databases
Apache Airflow, in combination with some of the most widely used vector databases (Weaviate, Pinecone, OpenSearch, pgvector) and natural language processing (NLP) providers (OpenAI, Cohere), offers extensibility through the latest in open-source development. Together, they enable a first-class experience in RAG development for applications like conversational AI, chatbots, fraud analysis, and more.
