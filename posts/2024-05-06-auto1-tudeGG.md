Bereaved parents and abuse survivors who have endured years of “preventable, life-changing harm” linked to social media say they have been denied a voice in official discussions about holding tech firms to account. Mariano Janin, whose ­daughter Mia, 14, killed herself after online bullying, and the parents of Oliver Stephens, 13, who was murdered after a dispute on social media, are among those who have accused Ofcom of excluding them from a ­consultation process for tackling online harms.

驻英国的家庭成员和网络虐待受害者表示，他们由于社交媒体而遭受了多年的“可以预防的、改变人生的伤害”，却被拒绝在有关追究科技公司责任的官方讨论中发表意见。

Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly, 14, killed herself after viewing self-harm content on Instagram and Pinterest, and parents who believe their children’s deaths were linked to viral social media challenges, also signed an open letter criticising the regulator, backed by 20 campaigners with lived experience. 

在Instagram和Pinterest上查看自残内容后，14岁的Molly自杀的Ian Russell，以及相信自己孩子的死与病毒性社交媒体挑战有关的父母，也签署了一封反映监管机构问题的公开信，得到了具有生活经验的20名倡导者的支持。


The families, together with survivors of online grooming and abuse, say that Ofcom has so far failed to properly engage with them, despite them having “deeply valuable insights” into the “devastating effects of online harm”.

这些家庭，以及在线诱导和虐待幸存者们表示，尽管他们对“网络伤害的毁灭性影响”拥有“非常宝贵的见解”，但Ofcom到目前为止尚未同他们进行有效沟通。


Their frustration is focused on a consultation process over Ofcom’s approach to protecting people from illegal harms online, which they say included more than 2,000 pages of “incredibly technical and inaccessible material”.

他们的不满集中在对Ofcom保护人们免受在线非法危害的方法进行磋商，他们表示这包括了超过2000页“极其技术性和难以理解的材料”。

...

Janin concluded: “It’s the wrong way around: we should put the bar high and they should have to prove they can run their platforms without risk.”

Janin总结道：“现在的情况是完全相反的：我们应该提高标准，让他们证明他们可以在没有风险的情况下运行他们的平台。”
