**Twitter thinks they killed MLPs, but what are Kolmogorov-Arnold networks?**

This article on Medium was written by Mike Young, a researcher in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The author discusses the recent advancements in the development of transformer-based architectures for NLP tasks. Specifically, he focuses on the Transformer-XL model and its ability to outperform other models on various benchmark datasets.

**The rise and fall of MLPs**

In the early days of NLP, multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures were widely used for many applications. However, with the advent of transformer-based models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, the popularity of MLPs began to wane. The author notes that Twitter, in particular, has been vocal about the supposed "death" of MLPs.

**Kolmogorov-Arnold networks: a new approach**

While transformer-based models have achieved great success, they are not without their limitations. One issue is that these models rely heavily on self-attention mechanisms, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In contrast, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative approach.

**What are KANs?**

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks were first introduced in a paper by the same authors who popularized the transformer architecture. The key idea behind KANs is to use a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to process sequential data. This approach allows for more efficient processing of long-range dependencies, which is particularly important for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation.

**Key advantages of KANs**

The author highlights several advantages of KANs over traditional transformer-based models:

1. **Efficiency**: KANs are computationally more efficient than transformers, requiring fewer parameters and less memory.
2. **Flexibility**: KANs can be easily adapted to process different types of sequential data, such as images or audio.
3. **Robustness**: KANs have been shown to be more robust to noise and outliers in the input data.

**Empirical results**

The author presents some empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of KANs on various NLP tasks, including language modeling and text classification. The results show that KANs can achieve comparable or even better performance than transformer-based models while being more efficient and flexible.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the article highlights the limitations of traditional transformer-based models and introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold networks as a viable alternative. While MLPs may have had their day in the sun, KANs offer a promising new direction for NLP research. The author notes that Twitter's claims about the "death" of MLPs are overstated, and that both architectures have their place in the NLP toolkit.
