 This collaboration gives VirusTotal access to ZeroFox’s threat intelligence data lake encompassing attacks, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and other threat data, giving the larger security community more visibility into external cyber threats in order to defend against them more effectively.
Every day, ZeroFox leverages its global intelligence collection and analysis to process tens of thousands of malicious URLs, IPs, and phishing domains. Access to this critical data is granted to select partners – now including VirusTotal – through integrations to ZeroFox’s Global Disruption Network (GDN), which publishes information on newly-found threats like malicious content for the threat intelligence community. Google’s VirusTotal now includes ZeroFox’s GDN intelligence on URLs, IPs and domains, providing users with even more actionable threat intelligence on potential digital risks.
“ZeroFox’s domain monitoring and threat intelligence solutions arm customers with the tools they need to detect and respond to threats across their external attack surfaces,” said John Prestridge, Chief Product Officer at ZeroFox. “We’re proud to partner with VirusTotal – the go-to organization for verifying any offending URL or IP – to give our shared customers greater visibility into the external cyber threats that pose a threat to them, like phishing URLs and malicious domains. Together, we’re working towards our mission of creating a safer digital world.”
“We’re thrilled to welcome ZeroFox to our security ecosystem! Their expertise in URL, IP, and domain intelligence will undoubtedly enhance our capabilities to empower our users with even more actionable threat intelligence,” said Vicente Diaz, Threat Intelligence Strategist at VirusTotal.
