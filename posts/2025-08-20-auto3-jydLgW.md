 Both the continuation vehicle, anchored by funds managed by Hamilton Lane (Nasdaq: HLNE), and the GI Data Infrastructure investment offered existing GI Partners limited partners the option to receive liquidity and provide Flexential with additional equity capital to meet rising demand from enterprise and AI customers.
The new capital will accelerate Flexential’s development of next-generation data centers and strengthen its high-density colocation presence across the United States. Together with the investment from funds managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners (MSIP), which closed in November 2024, Flexential has now raised approximately $1 billion of primary equity to fund the development of its data center pipeline.
“This transaction validates our conviction in Flexential’s leadership position in the data center market,” said Travis Pearson, Managing Director and Co-Head of Private Equity at GI Partners. “We are excited to continue our partnership with the Flexential team and look forward to supporting the company’s next phase of growth.”
“Flexential plays a critical role in the digital infrastructure ecosystem, supporting latency-sensitive enterprise, AI, and cloud workloads for a diverse base of blue-chip customers,” said Mark Prybutok, Managing Director and Head of GI Data Infrastructure. “We are excited to partner with the company and look forward to contributing to its future success.” As part of the transaction, Mr. Prybutok has also been appointed to Flexential’s Board of Directors.
“This transaction strengthens our ability to deliver long-term infrastructure projects and secures the capital needed to keep pace with surging demand for AI and enterprise computing,” said Chris Downie, CEO of Flexential. “It was made possible by the confidence existing and new investors have in our strategy, and it further positions Flexential to meet the complex needs of organizations across the country.”
The funding comes as vacancy rates in primary markets have dropped to record lows, data center pricing has approached historic highs, and power constraints are lengthening lead times for new deployments. In its 2025 State of AI Infrastructure Report, Flexential found that 44% of organizations believe infrastructure is the biggest barrier to AI adoption.
Flexential is tackling these issues through targeted expansion and sustained investment in its facilities and capabilities — including its FlexAnywhere® platform, which unites colocation, cloud, connectivity, and data protection services across 40+ data centers in 18 markets. The platform enables faster, more precise delivery, while supporting the scale and performance needs of latency-sensitive workloads, AI model training and inference, and multi-cloud operations.
“This capital enables us to accelerate site acquisition, guarantee power commitments, and bring projects online more quickly,” said Ryan Mallory, President and COO of Flexential. “We’ll be able to expand in capacity-constrained markets and pursue new opportunities while we continue to deliver the scale, reliability, and interconnection capabilities our customers depend on.”
