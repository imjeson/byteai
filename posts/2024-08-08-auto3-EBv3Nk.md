 (“DISCO”)(NYSE: LAW), a leader in AI-enabled legal technology, announced today the general availability of Cecilia Auto Review, a solution that enables users to perform high-quality document review using generative AI. Cecilia Auto Review, part of the Cecilia AI suite of capabilities, provides accurate, consistent tags for each document, allowing legal professionals to locate documents relevant to legal issues at the outset of a litigation or investigation.
Legal teams expend significant budget and resources on the first-pass document review stage, which can delay case strategy and impact a team’s ability to effectively counsel clients. Relying on human reviewers for first-pass document reviews can also be costly and lead to inconsistencies. Cecilia Auto Review is a generative AI tool that addresses these challenges by enabling attorneys to review documents faster and more consistently, with the ability to provide detailed explanations for each tagging decision.
General availability comes after a series of pilots with top Am Law firms, who came away impressed with the results. DISCO’s testing of Cecilia Auto Review on customer data demonstrated review speeds of 3,800 documents per hour — over a 24 hour period, equivalent to a 140-person review team working an eight-hour day — and precision and recall metrics 10-20% higher than typical from human reviewers. DISCO will leverage its deep bench of in-house expertise to support and optimize each customer’s experience with Cecilia Auto Review.
“DISCO has been at the forefront of the industry’s generative AI revolution, and we’ve become known for building intuitive products that apply during all phases of high-stakes litigation,” said Devin Kani, VP of Product Management. “Overall, the response from early users has been tremendous, with many telling us how it dramatically accelerated review with highly accurate results. We worked closely with users at top law firms on real case data throughout the development of Cecilia Auto Review, and it enabled us to continually improve our products so that lawyers can effectively leverage them to find evidence and develop their cases faster.”
“As we integrate AI-driven tools into the suite of solutions we offer our lawyers, we are excited to test promising tools. DISCO’s Cecilia Auto Review is such a tool – and we found the verified results of first pass document review to achieve an accuracy level that was game changing for our case team,” said Daryl E. Shetterly, Managing Director, Orrick Analytics, Global Operations & Innovation Center. “We believe generative AI solutions like Cecilia will fundamentally improve the practice of law and the value we deliver for our clients.”
DISCO’s evolving Cecilia AI suite gives law firms and corporations modern fact-finding tools that can empower lawyers to improve legal outcomes for their clients. For example, Cecilia Q&A’s newest functionality can allow lawyers to ask questions about any single document to securely obtain targeted insights or work product. Cecilia Auto Review is one of five generative AI capabilities DISCO has announced over the past 18 months, and will be the third to go to general availability.
“We are fortunate to be collaborating with DISCO on promising generative AI technology like Cecilia Auto Review, which enabled us to identify responsive documents with unprecedented speed,” said Shelby Rampolo, Associate, Perkins Coie LLP. “When my team is facing a large document review at the beginning of a key case, Cecilia can not only speed up our ability to advise the client but also enhance the accuracy of the review.”
