 This collaboration enables enterprises to build, deploy, and scale AI workloads with enhanced flexibility and control over performance, governance, and cost, leveraging Clarifai’s platform and Vultr’s global high-performance cloud infrastructure.
The collaboration brings together Clarifai’s full-stack AI platform, which covers everything from model development to deployment and governance, with Vultr’s global reach, security, regulatory compliance (including HIPAA, SOC 2+, and more), and operational excellence. Vultr’s infrastructure includes high-performance CPUs, managed Kubernetes through Vultr Kubernetes Engine (VKE), managed databases like Apache® Kafka, scalable storage, bare metal servers, and a wide choice of the latest AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, offering optimal price-to-performance.
Together, Clarifai and Vultr offer organizations the ability to run any model in any environment with complete control over performance, governance, and offering up to 90% cost savings.
“Combining capabilities with these leading industry partners means customers can now deploy and manage their AI workloads efficiently across Vultr’s global cloud, gaining full control over costs and performance while getting access to a broader range of GPUs,” said Alfredo Ramos, Chief Product & Technology Officer at Clarifai. “This is about enabling all clouds, all compute, and all AI models on one platform.”
By working together, joint Clarifai and Vultr customers can save at least 70% on the costs of the NVIDIA A100 80 GB compared to hyperscalers, with potential for greater savings through a longer-term commitment. Customers can purchase single A100 GPUs or in blocks of 8 GPUs.
Key highlights of the partnership include:

Any AI Model, Any GPU: Users can deploy any open-source, foundation, or custom AI model, including Clarifai’s own, across Vultr’s extensive GPU lineup, such as AMD Instinct™ MI300X, MI325X, and NVIDIA HGX™ B200, HGX™ H100, A100 PCIe, and L40S. This allows optimization for performance, power efficiency, or cost, supporting AI workloads from inference to fine-tuning.
Unified Compute Orchestration: Clarifai’s compute orchestration allows deploying any model in a secure, scalable, containerized environment managed via a single interface. Models are deployed across Vultr resources using managed Kubernetes clusters or bare metal servers, with dynamic provisioning and automatic scaling via Vultr Kubernetes Engine (VKE). Built-in governance provides centralized visibility over performance, cost, and access, simplifying AI operations and improving efficiency.
Edge AI Capabilities: Clarifai’s edge AI platform enables deploying lightweight, high-performance models directly to edge devices, including air-gapped and offline environments. Combined with Vultr’s global footprint of 32 data center regions reaching 90% of the global population with low latency (2-40 ms), this delivers real-time intelligence at the data source. This is particularly valuable for use cases like predictive maintenance, industrial quality control, public safety, and content moderation.

“Our partnership with Clarifai is exactly what the Vultr Cloud Alliance is all about—bringing together best-of-breed technologies to give customers real choice, real performance, and real value. Clarifai’s full-stack AI platform paired with Vultr’s global GPU infrastructure means organizations can build and deploy AI models faster, scale efficiently, and reduce cost. It’s a practical, high-impact solution for teams looking to take control of their AI workloads—whether in the cloud, at the edge, or across hybrid environments,” said Kevin Cochrane, Chief Marketing Officer, Vultr.
Joint solutions are applicable across various industries, including:

Energy, Aerospace, and Manufacturing: Implement predictive maintenance and improve asset management using AI for visual inspection, edge AI, and global infrastructure.
Media and Entertainment: Accelerate AI workloads for content moderation, metadata generation, and asset management on GPU instances. Leverage real-time image, video, and document analysis and state-of-the-art AI models for full motion video and sports analytics.
Defense and Public Safety: Deploy AI models for security surveillance, object detection, and domain awareness in secure, air-gapped, or edge environments.
