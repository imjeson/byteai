“We’re honored to be named the leader in IoT Edge Analytics Platforms alongside our partner SAS,” said ClearBlade Founder & CEO Eric Simone. “Our customers rely on our flexible IoT Edge application to not only connect their assets, but also to leverage machine data for real-time insights that improve safety, efficiency and sustainability. A great example of this is our solar farm work at SAS – we’re thrilled to share a leadership position with our innovative, valued partner.”“With AI and IoT analytics offered by SAS and partners like ClearBlade, organizations in manufacturing, energy, transportation and government can optimize operations, enhance worker safety, improve maintenance strategies, reduce emissions, mitigate flooding and much more,” said Jason Mann, Vice President of IoT at data and AI leader SAS. “The latest SPARK Matrix for IoT edge analytics platforms underscores the leadership of SAS and ClearBlade and the value we provide to our customers.”
Quadrant Knowledge Solutions defines the IoT edge analytics platform as “a software platform designed to collect, process, and analyze data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices at the edge of a network—close to the source where data is generated—and derive insights from it. The platform enables real-time or near-real-time analysis and decision-making without the need to send data to a centralized location for processing. By performing analytics at the edge, these platforms can reduce latency, bandwidth usage, and dependency on cloud services, making them ideal for use cases where real-time responsiveness, data privacy, or intermittent connectivity are critical factors. Overall, an IoT edge analytics platform empowers organizations to derive the potential of their IoT deployments by offering actionable insights and intelligence directly at the edge of the network. The key capabilities of an IoT edge analytics platform include data streaming, data management, edge analytics, fault tolerance and reliability, developer tools, and integration and interoperability.”
