Jankowski joins Lightmatter from NVIDIA, where she was vice president of investor relations and strategic finance during a period of unprecedented growth for the company.

Lightmatter has made foundational breakthroughs in photonics that enable data centers to increase in scale and performance by orders of magnitude, and with greater energy efficiency. With a generational performance lead, Lightmatter is poised to drive the data center photonics revolution,” said Jankowski. “I am thrilled to join this brilliant team of inventors, technologists, and accomplished industry executives to help scale the company for significant growth in the years ahead.”
Jankowski’s leadership position follows Lightmatter’s $310M fundraise in 2023, which valued the company at $1.2B, and comes at a time of significant growth for the company. For more information about open roles, visit https://lightmatter.co/people/join-us/.
